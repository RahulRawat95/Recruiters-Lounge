A website created with Struts 2.0 Framework, MySQL, JSP, HTML, CSS and Java. This project aims to be a platform where Job Recruiters can recruit Potential Candidates. Both recruiter and candidate can create profile, a candidate can apply for a job profile created by recruiter and the recruiter can sort out the application after going through the applicants profile and resume and can contact him/her for Job Interview through Gmail. The project had capabilities to store resumes and profile pictures separate for each user on the filesystem and store the profile information, job profile and applied jobs in MySQL along-with the capablity to send Gmail messages to the user.
